# Orchestration Notes for Kommt Ihr Tracht

I'm orchestrating this specifically for the WCO, so I'm setting up
the parts for our existing instruments. Roughly, I'm going to have
most of the new instruments doubling one of the existing parts (although
there are places where I'll switch it up based on what I think will sound
good). The basic parts and doublings:


* Violin 1
* Violin 2
* Viola, trumpet 2
* Cello, trombone
* Bass, Tuba
* Oboe 1
* Oboe 2, saxophone
* English horn (we don't have one) = trumpet 1
* Clarinet 1
* Clarinet 2
* French horn
* Bassoon, baritone horn
* Bass clarinet - doubling switching between cello, base, and cl1 octave down.
